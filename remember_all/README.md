# The Remember-All

A device to link events on google calendar on to a neopixel string.

It uses a logarithmic display of time so that the first few pixels are only a few seconds long, but this quickly scales up to pixels that are several days long. It accepts a list of calendars (which might only be one) and combines the events into one presentation.
