* Commit titles should fill in the blank "This commit will...". If anyone wants to phrase this using proper grammatical terms, please do!
* Commit bodies should include an unordered list of changes
* Project titles should sound like devices from The Wizarding World
* Use tabs for semantic whitespace then spaces for vertical alignment with non-whitespace characters
	* This is because I like having three spaces for my tab width, but some prefer other numbers. Let's support diversity.
	* What tabs then spaces means, in a simple example.
	  This list uses tabs to indicate that it a sub-list.
	  This paragraph (in the source code) has been written with tab-then-space indentation to create vertical alignment.
	* Your right to debate this does not confer upon me a duty to listen.
